# xOTA-Antenna-100W
**A pcb for a 100W Fnd Fed Half Wave Antennas (EFHW) for SOTA, POTA,... xOTA** <br /><br />

Based on my xOTA-Antenna Design (https://github.com/DG1JAN/xOTA-Antenna) I made an updated Version with a better Toroid for higher power (100W SSB) and lowe core losses.

## BOM (1:56 UnUn for EFHW)
1x PCB: custom order with Gerber Files from PCB manufacturer e.g. from https://www.jlcpcb.com 

1x Toroid - FairRite 2643101902 (DigiKey is a good source)

1.6m of Trafo wire - e.g. BLOCK	CUL 1mm

1x BNC Socket -e.g-  Amphenol B6252H7 / Teleg√§rtner J01001A0038 (or similar) 

1x Plastic Wedge (3D Print Part, STL is in the Repo,use PETG)

1x Cable Tie 2.5mm wide, 150cm long

1x 100pF  Ceramic Capaciator - e.g. TDK CC45SL3FD101JYVNA (DigiKey is a good source)

2x 4mm Banana Socket - e.g.	GTIWUNG	4mm Plug from Amazon
